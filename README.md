# Engineering-Toolbox
This was my first-ever hackathon project for an open project category. The program is made to make some of the tedious parts of Engineering calculations simpler with functions that can do them for you. Note that it is still important to know how to do these by hand if you are in Engineering, and that this is just a practical tool to save people some time.
