# Engineering-Toolbox
This was my first-ever hackathon project for an open project category. I attended the event while I was studying Engineering at the University of Toronto, and decided to make a summary of some of the calculations I found to be tedious to do by hand.
Note that it is still important to know how to do these by hand if you are currently studying Engineering, and that this is just a practical tool to save people some time.
The list of functions here is by no means an extensive list of the calculations involved in engineering. This is what I could write in roughly 23 hours, and is obviously limited to the calculations I encountered during first year.

# Language:
The entire program was written in Python, since I figured it would mostly be computational stuff for which Python would do fine. It was also just my preferred programing language.
The program requires just two python modules: I trtied to write most of the functions from scratch, rahter than using numpy or some other module. the Math module was used mostly just for the trig functions and pygame was also used just for an easy way to display visuals.

# Functions Included:
1 - Find the best Square Steel HSS for the given loads
2 - Find the moment of inertia of comon cross-sections
3 - Analyze truss structures based on truss dimensions and loading
4 - Analyze tensions in cables of suspension bridge
5 - Calculate the net force on a particle in 2D
